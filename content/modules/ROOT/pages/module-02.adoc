== Module 02: Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes

In this session, participants will learn how to work with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS).

The goal of the tasks in this part of the OpenShift Platform Plus lab  is to take you through the RHACS console/user interface and to observe network traffic maps to get you used to finding vulnerabilities in your clusters. After you are comfortable with the general look and feel of RHACS, we will create and apply some custom policies to affect pods at both deployment and runtime. 

If you have questions at any time, please don’t hesitate to ask!

=== RHACS Basics

RHACS provides the tools and capabilities to address the security needs of a cloud-native development approach on Kubernetes.

The RHACS solution offers visibility into the security of your cluster, vulnerability management, and security compliance through auditing, network segmentation awareness and configuration, security risk profiling, security-related configuration management, threat detection, and incident response. In addition, RHACS grants an ability to pull the actions from that tooling deep into the application code development process through APIs.

These security features represent any developer or administrator’s primary work across various environments, including multiple datacenters, private clouds, or public clouds that run Kubernetes clusters.

=== RHACS Features

Using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes, you can gain comprehensive Kubernetes security that includes the following use cases:

- *Visibility:* See your entire landscape of images, registries, containers, deployments, and runtime behavior.
- *Vulnerability* Management: Identify and remediate vulnerabilities in container images and Kubernetes across the entire software development life cycle.
- *Compliance:* Audit your systems against CIS Benchmarks, NIST, PCI, and HIPAA, with interactive dashboards and one-click audit reports.
- *Network Segmentation:* Visualize existing connections and enforce tighter segmentation using Kubernetes-native controls to reduce your blast radius.
- *Risk Profiling:* See all your deployments ranked by risk level, using context from Kubernetes' declarative data, to prioritize remediation.
- *Configuration Management:* Apply best practices for Docker and Kubernetes to harden your environment for a more secure and stable application.
- *Threat Detection:* Use rules, automated allow lists, and baselining to accurately identify suspicious activity in your running applications.
- *Incident Response:* Take action, from failing builds and blocking deployments to killing pods and thwarting attacks, using Kubernetes for enforcement.

== Lab Setup

To have the applications and vulnerabilities necessary for the demo, we need to introduce a few vulnerable applications into the cluster.

NOTE: This step is mandatory, you must deploy these applications into your cluster in order to work through the lab exercises.

The command below will clone the tutorial sources and set the *TUTORIAL_HOME* environment variable to point to the root directory of the tutorial and deploy the applications.

Please complete the following steps to configure your lab environment

- Click the button to run the command in the terminal.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/openshiftdemos/openshift-ops-workshops acs-workshop
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/acs-workshop"
kubectl apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/workshop/demo-apps/configuration --recursive
kubectl apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/workshop/demo-apps/ --recursive
----

CAUTION: These commands download and apply a significant number of manifests to your environment. All of these applications are insecure, and pose a significant threat if used elsewhere. Please use these commands with caution.

- To ensure the deployment was successful, run the following command and ensure that the applications are up and running.


[source,sh,role=execute]
----
kubectl get deployments -l demo=acs -A
----

The output should look similar to this:

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
NAMESPACE      NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
backend        api-server         1/1     1            1           0d
frontend       asset-cache        1/1     1            1           0d
log4shell      log4shell-app      3/3     3            3           0d
medical        reporting          1/1     1            1           0d
operations     jump-host          1/1     1            1           0d
payments       visa-processor     1/1     1            1           0d
spring4shell   spring4shell-app   3/3     3            3           0d
----

If all of the applications are up and running, feel free to proceed to the next stage. If they are not running, rerun the command set, or ask a proctor for assistance.

== Introducing the RHACS console and Vulnerability Management

The first section of this lab will focus on navigation and vulnerability management. This work will take place in the UI and require you to use both the dashboard and the lab environment.

=== Accessing the RHACS Console

In this section, you will confirm that you can connect to the RHACS portal. 

The following information will be available in the the main lab screen:

- The RHACS admin Credentials
- The URL for the RHACS portal

=== Logging into the RHACS Console

- From the main lab page, click the URL for the RHACS web console to head to the console's login page.

image::201-lab-environment.png[Lab Environment]

NOTE: You may get a warning page that the webpage is not private. During setup, RHACS can utilize your certification server to avoid these errors. It is also considered best practice to integrate the application with your authentication server.

- Click through the warning page to get to the RHACS console login page.

image::202-cert-warning.png[Certificate Warning]

image::203-login-page.png[Login Page]

- Log in with the ADMINISTRATOR credentials from the main demo page. These credentials are located with all of the demo credentials and will be underneath the RHACS console URL *(HINT: The Username is always admin)*.

image::204-admin-login.png[Admin Login]

- Ensure you maintain access to the console and keep your tab open for the future lab sections.

== Navigating the RHACS Console

In this section, you familiarize yourself with the RHACS portal, including its tabs, search capabilities and dashboard functionality.

The RHACS dashboard has four main sections:

. Top Bar
. Global Search
. Navigation Menu
. Dashboard

image::206-numbered-dashboard.png[Numbered Dashboard]

=== Top Bar

The top bar contains the following functionality: 

- Global Search 
- Command-line tools 
- Cluster Health 
- Documentation 
- API Reference 
- Enable Dark/Light Mode 
- Logged-in user account

image::207-top-bar.png[Top Bar]

=== Global Search

The ability to instantly find resources is essential to safeguard your cluster. Utilize the RHACS search feature to find relevant resources faster.

For example, you can use it to find deployments exposed to a newly published CVE or all deployments with external network exposure.

A search query consists of two parts:

- An attribute that identifies the resource type you want to search for.
- A search term that finds the matching resource.

For example, to find all violations in the *visa-processor* deployment, the search query is *Deployment:visa-processor*.

image::209-search-syntax.png[Search Syntax]

In this search query, Deployment is the attribute, and visa-processor is the search term.

NOTE: When using the search functionality you must click the provided info from the dropdown. RHACS maintains a library of searchable assets to help you search faster. If CVE or deployment cannot be searched it is most likely because the resource is not in the cluster or incorrectly typed.


=== Local Page Filtering

You can use local page filtering from within all views in the RHACS portal. Local page filtering works similarly to the global search, but only relevant attributes are available. You can select the search bar to show all available attributes for a specific view.

=== Common Search Queries

Here are some common search queries you can try in the RHACS search bar if you’d like to test its functionality.

|============
|Query|Example|Purpose
|CVE:<CVE_number>|CVE:CVE-2018-11776|Finding deployments that are affected by a specific CVE
|Privileged:<true_or_false>|Privileged:true|Finding privileged running deployments
|Exposure Level:<level>|Exposure Level:External|Finding deployments that have external network exposure
|============

NOTE: This is just a sample of the types of queries you can use to analyze your environment in RHACS. For additional examples of search queries, please see the RHACS documentation.

=== Navigation Menu

image::210-nav-menu.png[Navigation Menu]

The left-hand navigation menu provides access to each of the security use cases, as well as product configuration to integrate RHACS with your existing tooling. The navigation menu has the following items:

- Dashboard: Summary view of your environment
- Network Graph: Configured and actual network flows and the creation of Network Policies to implement network segmentation
- Violations: Events that do not match the defined security policies
- Compliance: Several industry and regulatory security standards, such as PCI DSS
- Vulnerability Management: Information about known vulnerabilities affecting your environment, including deployed workloads and infrastructure, risk acceptance and reporting.
- Configuration Management: Identification of potential misconfigurations that can lead to security issues
- Risk: Risks affecting your environment, such as suspicious executions
- Platform Configuration: RHACS configuration, policy management and integration details, including;
* Clusters
* Policy Management
* Integrations
* Access Control
* System Configuration
* System Health

=== Dashboard 

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) Dashboard provides quick access to the data you need. It contains additional navigation shortcuts and actionable widgets that are easy to filter and customize so that you can focus on the data that matters most to you. You can view information about levels of risk in your environment, compliance status, policy violations, and common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in images.

image::211-dashboard-center.png[Center Dashboard]

=== Navigating the Main Dashboard

The main Dashboard is your place to look at the vulnerabilities, risk, compliance, and policy violations across your clusters and namespaces. This section addresses all of the functionality in the main Dashboard to help you navigate it more effectively in the future.

The dashboard can be broken down into three main sections:

. The Status Bar
. The Dashboard Filter
. The Actionable Widgets

image::212-three-dashboards.png[Three Dashboard Sections]

=== The Status Bar

The Status Bar provides at-a-glance numerical counters for critical resources. The counters reflect what is visible with your current access scope, defined by the roles associated with your user profile. 

These counters are clickable, providing fast access to the desired list view pages as follows:

|============
|Counter|Destination
|Clusters|Platform Configuration -> Clusters
|Nodes|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Nodes
|Violations|Violations Main Menu
|Deployments|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Deployments
|Images|Vulnerability Management -> Dashboard -> Images
|Secrets|Configuration Management -> Applications & Infrastructure -> Secrets
|============

=== The Dashboard Filter 

The Dashboard includes a top-level filter that applies simultaneously to all widgets. You can select clusters and one or more namespaces within selected clusters. Any change to the filter is immediately reflected by all widgets, limiting the data they present to the selected scope.

NOTE: The Dashboard filter does not affect the Status Bar and when no clusters or namespaces are selected, the view automatically switches to All.

image::213-dashboard-filter.png[Dashboard Filter]

image::214-dashboard-dropdown.png[Dashboard Drop-down]

=== Actionable Widgets

If you have time, adjust the dashboard filtering options and widgets to hone the filtering capabilities.

You can customize the information displayed on the dashboard by default in order to find the items that you consider most important to your deployments and your business' security.
